# PolarisBiosEditor v1.6

Fork from lojkinKot

works on linux with mono, executable is build against .net 3.5

one click timing feature should be used with care, it maybe not stable for you

please build the executable yourself or decompile the existing one if you don't trust

rx5xx also supported

### v1.6
- window resizes properly now
- memory vendor detection
- one click timing patch (samsung, hynix, elpida, micron)

### v1.5

- implemented some timing editor related code (not usable yet)

### v1.4.1
- replaced WPF components with Windows Forms to archive mono compatibility
